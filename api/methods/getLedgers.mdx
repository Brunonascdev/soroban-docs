The `getLedgers` method is proposed but not yet implemented.
:::


Clients can request a list of ledgers. Soroban-RPC will support querying within a maximum 24 hours of recent ledgers.

## Parameters

- `startLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified ledger sequence number to fetch events after (inclusive).
- `endLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified ledger sequence number to fetch events before (inclusive). endLedger must be less than or equal to startLedger + 720 (about 1 hour of ledgers).

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `ledgers`: `<object[]>`
    - TODO: Figure out the object returned here.
