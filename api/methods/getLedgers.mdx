:::note
The `getLedgers` method is proposed but not yet implemented.
:::


Clients can request a list of ledgers. Soroban-RPC will support querying within a maximum 24 hours of recent ledgers.

## Parameters

- `startLedger`: `<string>` - Stringified ledger sequence number to fetch ledgers after (inclusive). If `startLedger` is greater than the latest ledger seen by this node, this method will return an error.
- `pagination`: `<PaginationOptions>` - See "[Pagination](../pagination)"

## Returns

- `<object>`
  - `ledgers`: `<object[]>`
    - TODO: Figure out the object returned here.
