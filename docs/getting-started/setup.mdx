Soroban contracts are small programs written in the [Rust] programming language.

To build and develop contracts you need only a couple prerequisites:

- A [Rust] toolchain
- An editor that supports Rust
- [Soroban CLI]

## Install Rust

If you use macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like OS, the simplest method to install
a Rust toolchain is to install `rustup`. Install `rustup` with the following
command.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

If you use Windows, or need an alternative method of installing Rust, check out:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

## Install the target

Install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Configure an Editor

Many editors have support for Rust. Visit the following link to find out how to
configure your editor:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools

A popular editor is Visual Studio Code:

- [Visual Studio Code] editor.
- [Rust Analyzer] for Rust language support.
- [CodeLLDB] for step-through-debugging.

[CodeLLDB]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb

## Install the Soroban CLI

The Soroban CLI can execute Soroban contracts in the same environment the
contract will execute on network, however in a local sandbox.

Install the Soroban CLI using `cargo install`.

```bash
cargo install --locked --version 20.0.0-rc.4.1 soroban-cli
```

### Usage

Run the `soroban` command and you should see output like below.

```bash
soroban
```

```bash
$ soroban
Build, deploy, & interact with contracts; set identities to sign with; configure networks; generate keys; and more.

Intro: https://soroban.stellar.org
CLI Reference: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-tools/tree/main/docs/soroban-cli-full-docs.md

Usage: soroban [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  completion  Print shell completion code for the specified shell
  contract    Tools for smart contract developers
  config      Read and update config
  events      Watch the network for contract events
  lab         Experiment with early features and expert tools
  version     Print version information

Options:
      --global                     Use global config
  -f, --filter-logs <FILTER_LOGS>  Filter logs output. To turn on "soroban_cli::log::footprint=debug" or off "=off". Can also use env var `RUST_LOG`
  -q, --quiet                      Do not write logs to stderr including `INFO`
  -v, --verbose                    Log DEBUG events
      --very-verbose               Log DEBUG and TRACE events [aliases: vv]
      --list                       List installed plugins. E.g. `soroban-hello`
  -h, --help                       Print help (see more with '--help')
  -V, --version                    Print version

TESTING_OPTIONS:
      --config-dir <CONFIG_DIR>
```

:::info

**Protip:** You can use `soroban completion` to generate shell completion for `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `zsh`. You should absolutely try it out. It will feel like a super power!!

To enable autocomplete in the current bash shell, run:

```bash
source <(soroban completion --shell bash)
```

To enable autocomplete permanently in future bash shells, run:

```bash
echo "source <(soroban completion --shell bash)" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Users of non-bash shells may need to adapt the above commands to suit their needs.

### Configuring the CLI

The Soroban CLI can work with Stellar networks, like Mainnet (Pubnet), Testnet, or a local network.

Use Testnet or a local network during development and testing:


**A Local test network...**

- Runs locally on a development machine.
- Requires Docker.
- Closes a new ledger every one (1) second. This makes it faster to develop against.
- Allows for customizing resource limits: matching testnet/pubnet, or unlimited.
- Can facilitate reproducible test runs with a blank slate.
- Unaffected by congestion on Testnet.
- Unaffected by Testnet resets.

** The Testnet test network...**

- Does not require Docker or any other software to start. It is already running, around the clock.
- Publicly and globally available, so your development work can be shared with others.
- Reset once per quarter, erasing all data.
- Closes a new ledger every five (5) seconds. Just like Mainnet (Pubnet).
- Uses a single set of resource limits: matching pubnet.
- Has a small ledger size of 100 operations, and may become congested.

<Tabs groupId="test-networks">
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

SDF operates a free-to-use, publicly-available test network called _Testnet_ that you can use to deploy and test your smart contracts. It's a live, globally available network, but it's not the same as the Stellar public network (also known as Mainnet). It's a separate network that is used for development and testing, so you can't use it for production apps or real assets. But it's a great place to test your contracts before you deploy them to the public network.

To configure your CLI to interact with Testnet, run the following command:

```bash
soroban config network add --global testnet \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org:443 \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

A local network is a fully featured Stellar network that runs the same protocol, software, and services as Testnet, or Mainnet, but it's isolated to your own local machine.

Prerequisites:
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Run the following command to download and start a `stellar/quickstart` container. The container will run in the foreground of the terminal and host a local network, including a Horizon API, Soroban RPC, and Friendbot Faucet:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --name stellar \
  stellar/quickstart:testing \
  --local \
  --enable-soroban-rpc
```

Then, configure your CLI to interact with the Local network:

```bash
soroban config network add --global local \
  --rpc-url "http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc" \
  --network-passphrase "Standalone Network ; February 2017"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note the `--global`. This creates a file in your home folder's `/.config/soroban/network/testnet.toml` with the settings you specified. This
means that you can use the `--network testnet` flag in any Soroban CLI command to use this network.

If you want project-specific network configurations, you can omit the `--global` flag, and the networks will be added to your working directory's `.soroban/network` folder instead.

### Configure an Identity

When you deploy a smart contract to a network, you need to specify an identity that will be used to sign the transactions.

Let's configure an identity called `alice`. You can use any name you want, but it might be nice to have some named identities that you can use for testing, such as [`alice`, `bob`, and `carol`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob).

```bash
soroban config identity generate --global alice
```

You can see the public key of `alice` with:

```bash
soroban config identity address alice
```

Like the Network configs, the `--global` means that the identity gets stored in `~/.config/soroban/identity/alice.toml`. You can omit the `--global` flag to store the identity in your project's `.soroban/identity` folder instead.

All this did so far is generate a public/private keypair on your local machine. No network requests were made, and `alice` has no funds on Testnet. This means that you can't make any transactions with `alice` yet.

To get `alice` some Testnet tokens, you'll need to use [Friendbot](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/fundamentals-and-concepts/testnet-and-pubnet#friendbot). All Stellar test networks have a Friendbot that you can use to get some test tokens. The public Friendbot instance for Testnet lives at `https://friendbot.stellar.org`. In a local network configuration, there is also a Friendbot available at `http://localhost:8000/friendbot`. Use this command to fund your test account:

<Tabs groupId="test-networks">
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Testnet">

```bash
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=$(soroban config identity address alice)"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="local" label="Local">

```bash
curl "https://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=$(soroban config identity address alice)"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip Command Expansion `$(...)`

This uses [command expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Command-Substitution.html), which only works with bash-compatible shells. If you are using Windows or some other shell, you will need to copy the output of `soroban configâ€¦` and paste it into the `curl` command, or figure out how command expansion works in your shell.
