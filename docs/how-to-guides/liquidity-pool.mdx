description: A constant-product liquidity pool contract.
---

The [liquidity pool example] demonstrates how to write a constant product liquidity pool contract. The comments in the [source code] explain how the contract should be used.

[liquidity pool example]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/tree/v0.7.0/liquidity_pool
[source code]: https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples/blob/v0.7.0/liquidity_pool/src/lib.rs#L143

## Run the Example

First go through the [Setup] process to get your development environment configured, then clone the `v0.7.0` tag of `soroban-examples` repository:

[Setup]: ../getting-started/setup.mdx

```
git clone -b v0.7.0 https://github.com/stellar/soroban-examples
```

Or, skip the development environment setup and open this example in [Gitpod][oigp].

To run the tests for the example, we will need to build the token contract and then run the test commands. First, navigate to the `liquidity_pool` directory, and use `make`.

```
cd liquidity_pool
make
```

You should see output that begins like this:

```
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/make
-C ../token || break;
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Once this is complete, you can run the tests:

```zsh
cargo test
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```zsh
running 1 test
test test::test ... ok

test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.04s
```
