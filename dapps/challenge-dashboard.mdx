## Overview of Features

The dashboard is intuitively designed to help you track your progress and navigate through the challenges with ease. At the top, you'll see your user address along with a summary of your completed challenges, offering a snapshot of your achievements.


## Utilities


`Log in` and `Log out` buttons are available to connect and disconnect your Freighter wallet. You will need to be logged in to start or continue a challenge and to see your leaderboard position.

Curious about how you rank against others? The `Show Rank` feature gives you a glimpse of your leaderboard status, spurring a friendly competition.

A `Refresh` button is available to update the information, this will make a call to the database that stores challenge data, ensuring that you are always looking at the most recent data regarding your standings and progress.

The `Reset` button allows you to reset your progress and start over. This will erase progress data in the database for ***ALL*** challenges, which will remove your position from the leaderboard. You will need to complete at least one challenge to be ranked again.

### Challenges Overview

Your challenges are categorized into three states:

- **Active Challenges**: Challenges that you have started but not yet completed will appear here. Each active challenge displays a progress bar and a "Continue" button, allowing you to resume your work right where you left off.

- **Completed Challenges**: Once you finish a challenge, it moves to the completed section. These challenges show a "Completed" status, marking your success and allowing you to review the completed work.

- **Upcoming Challenges**: Challenges that are available for you to start will be listed as well. These represent new opportunities for you to learn and demonstrate your skills.


The `Show my challenges` button will filter the catalog to only show challenges that are in progress or completed by you.


## Leaderboard

Toggle to the Leaderboard tab to see detailed rankings and find out where you stand in the larger community.
Leaderboard position is determined by the number of challenges completed, with the most TVL (Total Value Locked) as a tiebreaker.
